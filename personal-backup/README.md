# Personal Backup

This folder contains my personal database backup for the Apple Fitness+ Advanced Workout Filter project.

## Contents

- `fitness_cache.db` - My personal workout database with indexed Apple Fitness+ workouts

## Note

The main project directory contains a symbolic link (`fitness_cache.db`) that points to the database file in this folder. This allows the application to function normally while keeping my personal data backed up in version control.

For new users, the application will create a fresh database automatically when first run.
