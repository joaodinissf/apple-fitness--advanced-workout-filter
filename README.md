```

## Supported URL Formats

The application supports various Apple Fitness+ URL formats:

- `https://fitness.apple.com/us/workout/category-with-trainer/ID`
- `https://fitness.apple.com/gb/workout/category-with-trainer/ID` (automatically normalized)
- URLs with query parameters (automatically cleaned)

## Database Management

The application includes several utility scripts for database maintenance (located in the `utils/` folder):

- `utils/cleanup_duplicates.py` - Remove duplicate entries
- `utils/invalidate_cache.py` - Mark all entries for refresh
- `utils/check_db_health.py` - Verify database integrity
- `utils/fetch_html.py` - Debug tool for fetching workout HTML

## Configuration

The application uses SQLite for data storage with automatic schema migration. The database file (`fitness_cache.db`) is created automatically and stores:

- Workout metadata (title, trainer, duration, genre, etc.)
- Complete song playlists with Apple Music links
- Caching information for performance optimization

**Custom Database Location**: If you have an existing database in a different location, you can create a symbolic link to it:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/your/custom/backup/fitness_cache.db ./fitness_cache.db
```
